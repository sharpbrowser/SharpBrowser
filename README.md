SharpBrowser is the fastest open source C# web browser there is! Slightly faster than Google Chrome when rendering web pages due to lightweight CEF renderer. We compared every available .NET browsing engine and finally settled on the high-performance [CefSharp](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/). Released under the permissive MIT license.

## Features

- HTML5, CSS3, JS, HTML5 Video, WebGL 3D, WebAssembly, etc
- Tabbed browsing
- Address bar (also opens Google)
- Back, Forward, Stop, Refresh
- Developer tools
- Search bar (also highlights all instances)
- Download manager
- Custom error pages
- Custom context menu
- Easily add vendor-specific branding, buttons or hotkeys
- View online & offline webpages

## System requirements

- You need [VC++ 2019 Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) 32-bit and 64-bit versions

- You need .NET Framework 4.8.

- You need to install the version of VC++ Runtime that CEFSharp needs. Since we are using CefSharp 104, according to [this](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/#release-branches) we need the above versions


## Getting started

- See the [Compilation Guide](docs/Compilation.md) for steps to get started.


## Documentation

- [User Guide](docs/Users.md)
- [Compilation Guide](docs/Compilation.md)
- [Configuration Guide](docs/Configuration.md)
- [Distribution Guide](docs/Distribution.md)


## Code

- SharpBrowser uses CefSharp 104 and is built on NET Framework 4.8
- SharpBrowser supports AnyCPU as well as x86/x64 specific builds
- `MainForm.cs` - main web browser UI and related functionality
- `Handlers` - various handlers that we have registered with CefSharp that enable deeper integration between us and CefSharp
- `Data/JSON.cs` - fast JSON serializer/deserializer
- `bin` - Binaries are included in the `bin` folder due to the complex CefSharp setup required. Don't empty this folder.
- `bin/storage` - HTML and JS required for downloads manager and custom error pages
